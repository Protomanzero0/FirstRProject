# FirstRProject

# Overview

Before I started focusing on Computer Science as my major in college, I was in the biology field. As such, data visualization for studies was something that I knew would be
useful to learn at some point; R seemed to be the main standard as a sort of marriage between CS and research fields. It always looked too intensive to attempt to learn,
but I found that it's really not as bad as it seems (once you get through the setup process, that is). 

The software I wrote is in 2 pieces; the first, "trial.R", is a sandbox of sorts where I was learning the basic syntax, assignments, and BIFs of the language. The second,
"project1.R" is the application of what I learned, showing variable assignment, function definitions, stat plotting, the use of different datatypes, and data frames. 

I decided to write this because I've always been curious about what R is all about. Seeing high-level examples makes it seem really daunting to learn, but at its core it's
really simple and easy to write in. 

# Development Environment

I wrote these programs using Visual Studio Code as my editor, alongside an extension that provides autocomplete and style guiding. 

These programs were written in R using a few different libraries, including languageserver, radian, httpgd, and dplyr. 

# Useful Websites

A list of sites that were useful in getting started:

- [R in VSCode Setup Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r#:~:text=Getting%20started&text=For%20Windows%20users%2C%20it%20is,Install%20languageserver%20in%20R.&text=Install%20the%20R%20extension%20for,R%20file%20and%20start%20coding.)
- [W3 Schools' R Guides](https://www.w3schools.com/r/default.asp)
- [Statology's R Tutorials](https://www.statology.org/r-guides/)
- [Statmethod's Quick-R Guides](https://www.statmethods.net/index.html)

# Future Work

Some things I'd like to work on for future applications:

- Writing a program that recieves data through a CSV file for plotting
- Somehow making data frames look a lot nicer to read
- Getting better with style guiding (my R code is a little ugly)
